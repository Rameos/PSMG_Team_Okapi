This Station does not rely on an external power-supply. It is completely autonomous in its energy-production. The energy-management system is designed to match the highest standards in efficiency and security. In the unlikely case of malfunction in the main reactor, small back-up generators will engage. These will provide electricity for life-support, doors, lights and internal communications.
